Installation
------------

1. Clone into your home directory:

  ```bash
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/RobbieClarken/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
  ```
  
2. Read `~/.dotfiles/install.sh` and make sure you understand what it is going to do because it will override existing dotfiles.
3. Run the install script:

  ```bash
  ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
  ```
  
4. Update `~/.gitconfig` with your username and email.
5. If on Mac OS X, run the following to install the Monokai Terminal theme:

   ```bash
   open ~/.dotfiles/monokai.terminal/Monokai.terminal
   ```
